# Carbon Intensity in the UK

> This Single-Page Application (SPA) allows you to monitor carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions for each region of the UK and the nation itself. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are updated every half hour. The App contains a search field for the user to quickly look up the region of interest. Also, it displays a details page for every region showing the CO<sub>2</sub> percentage contribution by energy source.
